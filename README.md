# This is deprecated - Use [browser_mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) instead

Lovelace plugin for use with
[Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.ozerov.de/fully-kiosk-browser/).

This enables home-assistant to monitor and controll te screen of an android device currently viewing your lovelace UI. It can also lets you add a sensor for motion in front of the camera of the device as well as battery and charging status.

## Installation

1. Copy [`lovelace-fullykiosk.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasloven/lovelace-fullykiosk/master/lovelace-fullykiosk.js) to `<ha config>/www/lovelace-fullykiosk.js`

2. Add a `light` and `binary_sensor` to your home-assistant config

```yaml
light:
  - platform: template
    lights:
      dashboard_screen:
        turn_on:
        turn_off:
        set_level:

binary_sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: dashboard_motion
    state_topic: any/value
```

3. Add a file `<ha config>/www/kiosk-config.js` with the following contents:

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  LovelaceFullyKiosk.bind("fully_kiosk_id", "light.dashboard_screen", "binary_sensor.dashboard_motion");
}, 200);
```
where `fully_kiosk_id` is the Device ID from Fully Kiosk Browser (available
under `Settings->Other Settings`).

4. Add the `.js` files as resources in `ui-lovelace.yaml`

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/lovelace-fullykiosk.js
    type: js
  - url: /local/kiosk-config.js
    type: js
```

5. In Fully Kiosk Browser, Enable `Settings->Advanced Web Settings->Javascript
   Interface (PLUS)` and `Settings->Motion Detection (PLUS)->Enable Visual
   Motion Detection`

6. Point Fully Kiosk Browser to your lovelace UI.

---

You should now be able to turn the screen on or off and adjust it's brightness
from home-assistant. The light switch should also update if you turn the screen
on or off manually.

The motion sensor in home-assistant should activate for five seconds if
something moves in front of the camera.

Both the screen light and the motion sensor has the attributes `battery_level`
and `charging` which contains battery and charge status.

## If things don't work

First things first: Check your home-assistant log. Does it say something about
"`Unexpected token <`"? If so, you need to download the RAW file from github,
not the html version. Use the link from point 1 in the installation
instructions.

If the log says something about "`kiosk-config.js:1:20`" you caught me before I
changed a bug in the documentation. Make sure the first line of
`kiosk-config.js` says `function`, not `functon`.

If the log says something about "`FullyKiosk.bind is not a function`", You're probably running the latest version of Fully Kiosk Browser, but not of the script. Download the script again, and make sure that you change every occurence of `FullyKiosk` in your `kiosk-config.js` to `LovelaceFullyKiosk`.

If that didn't work, you'll need to know a little trick.
When you change a script (e.g. `kiosk-config.js`), you need to avoid that your
browser gets a cached version without your new changes. The easiest way to do
this is to add `?1` after the URL in `ui-lovelace.yaml`, and increase that
number every time you make a change.

The first change you need to make to `kiosk-config.js` is to add
`LovelaceFullyKiosk.debug();` before `}, 200);`. Then increase the number, reload the
page, and you should see that the title of the lovelace page has changed. Hopefully the new title will give you some hints as to what might be wrong.

If not, I recommend checking the home-assistant log and the log output of your computers browser.

## Camera

Bonus note: To get a camera view from the device into
home-assistant, enable `Settings->Remote Administration
(PLUS)->Enable Remote Administration` and `Settings->Remote
Administration (PLUS)->Remote Admin from Local Network`. Set an
admin password under `Settings->Remote Administration (PLUS)->Remote
Admin Password`. Then add

```yaml
camera:
  - name: dashboard_camera
    platform: generic
    still_image_url: http://ip-of-device:2323?cmd=getCamshot&password=your_admin_password
```

to your home-assistant config.

## Media player

The project which inspired this plugin -
[ha-floorplan-kiosk](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan-kiosk)
by Petar Kozul - also allows the device to be used as a media player.

Since this function does not depend on Fully Kiosk Browser, I put that in a
separate plugin:
[lovelace-player](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-player).
